Running List Of Everything We Need:
Can we get a brief description of the characteristics of these things, plz?

* Sprites
   - We need to make custom sprites in Gimp2 so we don't get sued for copyright.
   - Instead of pokemon we should base the sprites on different creatures:
     - Classes
      - God Tier (Don't know yet)
      - Mythical (ex: Dragons, Phoenix, Leviathan)
      - Real World (Polar Bear, Wolf, etc.)
    - We also need a new tileset so as not to get copyrighted
     - We'll have to come up with a theme together so we'll know what they need to look like
* TileMaps
   - Take those "brand spanking new tilesets" and make some "BOSS" maps out of them
   - Maps should be open world design like breath of the wild
* Battle System
   - Need collisions in tiles (Tall Grass Tiles in Pokemon) to activate battle sequences
   - Need to come up with the battle sequence
      - Options for attack
      - Item usage
      - Spawning random enemies 
* Animations
   - Walking animations for player character and other in game characters
* Collisions
   - We need to fix the tile collisions so the character quits spazzing out of bounds.
* Map Layers
   - I don't remember what this one was - probably something with the collisions
* Actor Database
   - Actors = Pokemon
   - Create some kind of database to store the actor values
      - Stats (Attack, Speed, etc)
      - Held Items
      - Abilities
      - Rarity
      - Etc.
* Menus
    - When a key is pressed a START menu pops up
    - Link that to things like accessing the database, access the store of items, etc
